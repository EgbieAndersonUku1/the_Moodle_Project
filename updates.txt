Changes to the application:

1) Refactored the application so the framework no longer displays all the available roles for a user e.g course-creators,
   non-editing teachers, students or guests when the dot extension is hit on the User object.
   Instead, the framework detects the particular role assigned to the user through their logging credentials then
   displays only that role along with the pages and options they can use.

   * For example, if the username and password are blank then the framework only displays the Guest option/pages
     that only a guest can access and nothing else.

   This is also done for either a course creator or Non-editing teacher

   example (1):

   m = Runner('http://some_url_to_moodle')

   To Login in as Guest leave the username and password blank by hitting "<ENTER>"
   [+] Enter your moodle username(with quotations e.g 'username') : 'username_for_course_creator'
   [+] Enter your moodle password(with quotations e.g 'password') : 'password_for_course_creator'

   # Application detects that user is a course-creator and displays only the options available to a course-creator
   >>> m.Users.CourseCreator.Browser.Pages.GoTo.LoginPage.Login.UserLogin.login()
   >>> m.Users.CourseCreator.Browser.GoTo.Page.LoginPage.Logout.log_out()
